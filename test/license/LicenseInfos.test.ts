ConditionsSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses grantedin Section 2.1.3. Responsibilities3.1. Distribution of Source FormAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including anyModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be underthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the SourceCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License,and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alteror restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.3.2. Distribution of Executable FormIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the ExecutableForm how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable meansin a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to therecipient; andYou may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, orsublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for theExecutable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights inthe Source Code Form under this License.3.3. Distribution of a Larger WorkYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for theCovered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Softwarewith a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the CoveredSoftware is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permitsYou to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of suchSecondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at theiroption, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either thisLicense or such Secondary License(s).3.4. NoticesYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (includingcopyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations ofliability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedyknown factual inaccuracies.3.5. Application of Additional TermsYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnityor liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. Youmust make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, orliability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnifyevery Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result ofwarranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

This disclaimer of warrantyconstitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Softwareis authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.7. Limitation of LiabilityUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes CoveredSoftware as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure ormalfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such partyshall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation ofliability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting fromsuch party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental orconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.8. LitigationAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of ajurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business andsuch litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without referenceto its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’sability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.9. MiscellaneousThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shallbe reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change freesoftware-to make sure the software is free for all its users.  ThisGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free SoftwareFoundation\'s software and to any other program whose authors commit tousing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered bythe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it toyour programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of itin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if youdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whethergratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights thatyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get thesource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know theirrights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,distribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author\'s protection and ours, we want to make certainthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this freesoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, wewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, sothat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the originalauthors\' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by softwarepatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a freeprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making theprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that anypatent must be licensed for everyone\'s free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSETERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License applies to any program or other work which containsa notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into anotherlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation inthe term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Programis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on theProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\'ssource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that youconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriatecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all thenotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this Licensealong with the Program.You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, andyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third    parties under the terms of this License.    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Program.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Programwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License.  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms ofSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium    customarily used for software interchange; or,    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you    received the program in object code or executable form with such    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete sourcecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus anyassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used tocontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as aspecial exception, the source code distributed need not includeanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binaryform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of theoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that componentitself accompanies the executable.If distribution of executable or object code is made by offeringaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalentaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts asdistribution of the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Programexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program isvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you underthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as suchparties remain in full compliance.  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on theProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Program or works based on it.  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on theProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject tothese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties tothis License.  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable underany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended toapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in othercircumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system, which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this Licensemay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excludingthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or amongcountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporatesthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions willbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail toaddress new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Programspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "anylater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditionseither of that version or of any later version published by the FreeSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number ofthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free SoftwareFoundation.  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the authorto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the FreeSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimesmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goalsof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software andof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.NO WARRANTY  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHENOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIESPROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSEDOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OFMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK ASTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THEPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  12.

By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software-to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages-typically libraries-of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.  If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor\'s reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user\'s freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operatingsystem.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers\' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  Theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run.GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSETERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you".  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".)  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,    in the event an application does not supply such function or    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of    its purpose remains meaningful.    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any    application-supplied function or table used by this function must    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square    root function must still compute square roots.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change inthese notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer\'s own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do oneof these things:    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application    to use the modified definitions.)    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a    copy of the library already present on the user\'s computer system,    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at    least three years, to give the same user the materials    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more    than the cost of performing this distribution.    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above    specified materials from the same place.    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things:    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the    Sections above.    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS```Appendix C: The MPL License---------------------------```MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 1.11.

Distribution Obligations.     3.1. Application of License.     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this     License or the recipients\' rights hereunder. However, You may include     an additional document offering the additional rights described in     Section 3.5.     3.2. Availability of Source Code.     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.     3.3. Description of Modifications.     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters          (a) Third Party Claims.          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party\'s          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.          (b) Contributor APIs.          If Contributor\'s Modifications include an application programming          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must          also include this information in the LEGAL file.               (c)    Representations.          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor\'s          Modifications are Contributor\'s original creation(s) and/or          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by          this License.     3.5. Required Notices.     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation     for the Source Code where You describe recipients\' rights or ownership     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or     collateral in which You describe recipients\' rights relating to the     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient\'s     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such     terms You offer.     3.7. Larger Works.     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to     understand it.5. Application of this License.     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.6. Versions of the License.     6.1. New Versions.     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version     will be given a distinguishing version number.     6.2. Effect of New Versions.     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to     Covered Code created under this License.     6.3. Derivative Works.     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of     this License.)7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.8. TERMINATION.     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License     shall survive.     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:     (a)  such Participant\'s Contributor Version directly or indirectly     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of     the 60 day notice period specified above.     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant\'s     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that     Participant.     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant     alleging that such Participant\'s Contributor Version directly or     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or     license.     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder     prior to termination shall survive termination.9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY\'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those     rights set forth herein.11. MISCELLANEOUS.     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees and     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this     License.12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License     Version 1.1 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in     compliance with the License.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]                            Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.  If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor\'s reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.\f  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user\'s freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operatingsystem.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers\' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  Theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run.\f                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you".  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".)  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.\f  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,    in the event an application does not supply such function or    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of    its purpose remains meaningful.    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any    application-supplied function or table used by this function must    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square    root function must still compute square roots.)These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change inthese notices.\f  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\f  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer\'s own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do oneof these things:    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application    to use the modified definitions.)    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a    copy of the library already present on the user\'s computer system,    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at    least three years, to give the same user the materials    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more    than the cost of performing this distribution.    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above    specified materials from the same place.    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.\f  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things:    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the    Sections above.    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License.\f  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.\f  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.                            NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\f           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public License).  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.    <one line to give the library\'s name and a brief idea of what it does.>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU    Lesser General Public License for more details.    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USAAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, ifnecessary.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:        i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives           the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a           performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for           the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)           of the Work.        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights            agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for            any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and            distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC            Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other            jurisdictions).    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where       the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,       whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),       royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to       the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or       the equivalent in other jurisdictions).The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafterdevised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technicallynecessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted byLicensor are hereby reserved.4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limitedby the following restrictions:    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform       the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or       the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of       the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally       perform.

You may not distribute,       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any       technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner       inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the       Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective       Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If       You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the       extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by       clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any       Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any       credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.    b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the       Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all       copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means       You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)       if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another       party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution       in Licensor\'s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the       name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent       reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor       specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a       Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work       (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on       original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any       reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or       Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable       authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other       comparable authorship credit.5.

Notwithstanding the       above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license       terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any       such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has       been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this       License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.8.
